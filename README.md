# Davids Portfolio

In this challenge I had to make a profile about myself.

## Process

~So what I had to do was I made my html.
~ Then I added my css to fix any of the stylings that i wanted
~ Then i had to place everthing in the right place using css.
~ I also have to make it so that myself or anyone else can see it and use it on any other device like phone or tablet or than the computer.

## My link to my page

~Link: url:"https://jaajarbinks.github.io/DavidsPortfolio/"
~Getting the links on the page where difficult to fix but in the end I got them
